## Dataset

This dataset is about retail transaction data for a UK-based online store from 2009 to 2011.
It includes information about products, customers, and transactions.
There are over 1 million transactions included in the dataset.
The data includes product descriptions, prices, and customer locations.

Dataset: [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii)

## SEMMA Methodology

In this project, we are implementing the SEMMA methodology, which stands for Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess. Here's a brief explanation of each step:

Sample: In this step, we extract a representative sample from the Online Retail II dataset. This ensures that the data we are working with is manageable and representative of the larger dataset.

Explore: The exploration phase involves understanding the characteristics of the data. We perform descriptive statistics, data visualization, and other exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns, outliers, and potential relationships between variables.

Modify: This step involves data preparation and modification. We handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling. Cleaning the data and dealing with outliers are also part of this step.

Model: In the modeling phase, we apply machine learning algorithms to build predictive models or uncover patterns within the data. This involves training models on the prepared dataset, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance.

Assess: Finally, we assess the models' performance and draw conclusions. This includes evaluating the models against a test dataset, analyzing the results, and making recommendations or decisions based on the findings.

## XML Diagrams

The /diagrams directory contains XML diagrams corresponding to each SEMMA step. 

## Jupyter Notebook

The SEMMA_Findings.ipynb notebook in this repository serves as the main hub for our analysis.
